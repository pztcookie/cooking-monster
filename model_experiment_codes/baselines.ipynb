Add the eggs and mix well as needed. Do not add any more flour in the finished mix unless you are using the same mixing method and you're using the same butter or margarine. For the butter, DO NOT add the beaten eggs. Melt the milk or margarine in a small saucepan. If it is too thick, add the water and continue the heat to cook for a couple of more minutes or it won't start to brown. Once the butter is hot enough, gently stir in the chopped fresh herbs into it and stir in a small spoonful (add more water if necessary). Be sure the butter is thick at this point. Let cool slightly and use it later. For the icing cream, do make sure the butter has just cooled down enough to help it adhere to your icing. Allow it to cool completely before adding it. If you're making the egg filling, leave it outside cold. You want it soft so that it never sticks to the pan. Place in the refrigerator.
